Rejecting this request prevents each system trying to takeover its partner simultaneously. If the partner persists and the system doesn't become impaired the request will soon be granted.
*Corrective Action*::
Resolve any impairment issues reported in previous messages that would cause takeover. If takeover is requested by the operator, it should only be requested on one node.

*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This event is emitted when we detect that the partner sees more of our disk shelves than we do. In other words, it sees more shelves on its FCAL B loop than we see on our A loop. This is probably due to a cabling problem or a broken FCAL host adaptor. If "disk_shelf" negotiated failover is enabled, this condition should lead to a takeover by the partner if the partner is otherwise able to take us over.

Resolve the differences in disks visible to both systems. Verify that the interconnect cables are properly cabled. -automatic takeover disabled: Use the "storage failover takeover" command manually. -metrocluster disaster recovery operation is in progress: The local node is performing a MetroCluster(tm) disaster recovery operation; wait for it to finish, and then try again. This corrective action does not apply for ASA r2. -This node or partner node is in switchover state and the MetroCluster configuration option "node-object-limit" is off in the disaster recovery(DR) group of this node: Retry takeover after doing a switchback.

This corrective action does not apply for ASA r2. -HA takeover disabled: Use the "storage failover modify -enabled true" command to reenable HA functionality. -partner mailbox disks not accessible or invalid: Check connectivity to all disks by running the "storage show" nodeshell command on each node and comparing the results. Resolve the differences in disks visible to both systems. Verify that the interconnect cables are properly cabled. -failover monitor version mismatch: Make sure that both the local and partner node are running the same version of Data ONTAP(R). -Takeover disabled by partner: Use the "storage failover modify -enabled true" command to reenable HA functionality. -Takeover disabled by operator: Use the "storage failover modify -enabled true" command to reenable HA functionality. -NVRAM size mismatch: Make sure that the local NVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) size matches the partner node. -version mismatch: Make sure that both the local and partner nodes are running the same version of Data ONTAP. -interconnect error: Make sure that the interconnect link is connected and functioning. -partner booting: Wait for the partner node to complete its booting process, and then try takeover. -shelf too hot: Make sure that the disk shelf temperature is properly regulated. -partner is performing revert: Wait for the partner node to complete the revert process, and then try takeover. -revert is in progress: Wait for the local node to complete the revert process, and then try takeover. -partner is attempting takeover: Cannot perform a takeover operation while the partner node is attempting a takeover. -takeover is in progress: The local node is already taken over or is trying to take over the partner node. -partner halted in notakeover mode: The partner node was most likely halted using the "halt -f" or "system node halt -inhibit-takeover" command; reboot the partner node, and then try again. -unsynchronized log: Make sure that the interconnect link is connected and functioning. -unknown notakeover reasons: Contact NetApp technical support. -waiting for partner to recover: The partner has not booted completely after giveback; wait for the partner to come back up completely. -low memory: Contact NetApp technical support to upgrade. -local halt in progress: The local node is about to halt; try again after the reboot. -status of backup mailbox is uncertain: Check connectivity to all disks by running the "run local storage show" command on each node, and then comparing the results. Resolve the differences in disks visible to both systems. Verify that the interconnect cables are properly cabled. -automatic takeover disabled: Use the "storage failover takeover" command manually. -metrocluster disaster recovery operation is in progress: The local node is performing a MetroCluster(tm) disaster recovery operation; wait for it to finish, and then try again. This corrective action does not apply for ASA r2. -This node or the partner node is in switchover state and the MetroCluster configuration option "node-object-limit" is off in the disaster recovery(DR) group of this node: Retry takeover after doing a switchback. This corrective action does not apply for ASA r2.
