== configbr.backupFailedBM
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when when the configuration backup cannot be created.
*Corrective Action*::
Verify the boot media file system is available and has enough space to create a backup. From the systemshell, run the "df /droot/etc" command to check the available space on the boot media. Or adjust the size of the memory-backed scratch space using the "configuration backup settings modify" command (privilege: diagnostic). If the scheduled backup could not be created, create a backup file manually with the (privilege: advanced) "system configuration backup create" command, find the remote URL for uploading with the (privilege: advanced) "system configuration backup settings show -fields destination" command, and upload the backup with the (privilege: advanced) "system configuration backup upload" command.
*Syslog Message*::
The %s configuration backup %s cannot be created. Error: '%s'.
*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Type of backup, either cluster or local.
*backup* (STRING): Backup file.
*reason* (STRING): Reason for the error.
