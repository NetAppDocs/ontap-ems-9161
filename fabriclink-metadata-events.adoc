== fabriclink.metadata.too.long
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when object replication encounters metadata key-value pairs that are too long when replicating an object from a remote object store. The object will be replicated without the metadata key-value pairs that are too long.
*Corrective Action*::
Refer to the sktrace.log file for additional details about the objects that are replicated without some or all metadata. Reduce the size of individual metadata key-value pairs for objects if they should be replicated with the object.
*Syslog Message*::
There are objects with metadata key-value pairs that are too long to be replicated.
*Parameters*::
(None).
