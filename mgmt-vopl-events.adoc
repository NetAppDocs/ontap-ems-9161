NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a "volume move" operation fails to take offline the quiesced volume remaining after moving a clone parent, because wafliron is running.

== mgmt.vopl.rehost.failed
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a volume rehost job attempts to rehost a volume from one Vserver to another and is unsuccessful. This might happen if the target volume is being accessed by some other Data ONTAP(R) operations (for example, volume move); if the target volume is in a relationship, such as a SnapMirror DP relationship; or if the aggregate hosting the volume is undergoing a wafliron process. The system makes its best effort to revert the rehost procedure and make the volume available under the source Vserver. Subsequent attempts to rehost this volume might be successful; if the volume rehost revert procedure still fails, use the command "debug vreport" to fix volume discrepancies.
*Corrective Action*::
Follow the instructions provided as part of the volume rehost error and retry the operation after some time. If the volume rehost revert procedure fails and there are volume discrepancies, use command "debug vreport" in diagnostic mode to fix volume discrepancies.
