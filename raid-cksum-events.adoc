Please restore the corrupted file from snapshot or from the backup media.
*Syslog Message*::
Checksum error due to WAFL context mismatch on %s %s%s, %s, disk block %llu, buftree ID %d, %s inode number %d, snapshot ID %d, file block %llu, level %d: checksum context has buftree ID %d, file block %llu, %s.

== raid.cksum.zeroed.blkErr
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
