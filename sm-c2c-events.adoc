== sm.c2c.rebaseline.xfer
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when SnapMirror(R) performs a SnapMirror Cloud rebaseline transfer because certain conditions for an incremental transfer haven't been met between the source volume and the object-store destination endpoint of the transfer.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
This will be a rebaseline transfer because certain conditions for an incremental transfer haven't been met between the source volume '%s' and the destination object-store endpoint '%s', with endpoint uuid '%s', and relationship uuid '%s'. Refer to the sktrace logs for additional details on which conditions haven't been met.
*Parameters*::
*src_path* (STRING): Path name of the source volume of the SnapMirror relationship.
*dst_ep_path* (STRING): Path name of the destination object-store endpoint of the SnapMirror relationship.
*dst_ep_uuid* (STRING): UUID of the destination object-store endpoint of the SnapMirror relationship.
*rel_uuid* (STRING): UUID of the SnapMirror relationship.

== sm.c2c.xfer.fail.no.com.snap
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a SnapMirror(R) Cloud transfer fails because there is no common snapshot between the source volume and the object-store destination endpoint of the transfer.
*Corrective Action*::
Retry the transfer by passing a specific snapshot name using the "-s" option. Note that once you choose to go ahead with that option, you will not be able to transfer snapshots older than the specified snapshot. So it is suggested to select a snapshot that is older than the snapshots that you would like to be backed up per schedule.
*Syslog Message*::
There is no common snapshot between the source volume '%s' and the destination object-store endpoint '%s', with endpoint uuid '%s', and relationship uuid '%s'.
*Parameters*::
*src_path* (STRING): Path name of the source volume of the SnapMirror relationship.
*dst_ep_path* (STRING): Path name of the destination object-store endpoint of the SnapMirror relationship.
*dst_ep_uuid* (STRING): UUID of the destination object-store endpoint of the SnapMirror relationship.
*rel_uuid* (STRING): UUID of the SnapMirror relationship.
