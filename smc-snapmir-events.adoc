== smc.snapmir.dst.invalidType
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the destination volume of a SnapMirror(R) relationship is not a Data Protection (DP) type and a snapmirror initialize operation is attempted. A volume must be of a DP type to accept a snapmirror initialize operation.
*Corrective Action*::
For ASA r2 systems, contact NetApp technical support for assistance to resolve this internal error. For all other systems: Use a different volume of type DP, or use the "volume create" command to create a new volume of type DP to use as a destination of the SnapMirror relationship. You cannot modify the type of a volume using the 'volume modify' command.
*Syslog Message*::
Destination volume '%s' of a SnapMirror relationship is not a DP type. Relationship UUID "%s".
*Parameters*::
*dstpath* (STRING): Path name of the destination volume of the SnapMirror relationship.
*relationshipID* (STRING): Universal unique identifier(UUID) of the SnapMirror relationship.

== smc.snapmir.frest.clean.fail
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when SnapMirror(R) fails to clean up fenced files and file restore restartability information on a volume and no more retries will be attempted.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the reason for the error, take action accordingly and issue 'snapmirror restore -file-restore-clean-up true' on the volume in diagnostic mode.
*Syslog Message*::
File restore clean up on volume '%s' failed with error '%s'.
*Parameters*::
*dstpath* (STRING): Path name of the volume.
*error* (STRING): Error message.

== smc.snapmir.init.fail
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a SnapMirror(R) 'initialize' command fails and no more retries will be attempted.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the reason for the error, take action accordingly, and issue the command again.
*Syslog Message*::
Initialize from source volume '%s' to destination volume '%s' failed with error '%s'. Relationship UUID '%s'.
*Parameters*::
*srcpath* (STRING): Path name of the source volume of the SnapMirror relationship.

== smc.snapmir.lrb.auto.resync
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when the latest snapshot on the SnapMirror(R) or SnapVault(R) destination is not the base snapshot and the source volume is read-only. Generally this is a rare event and a local-rollback-based SnapMirror resync will be attempted to automatically recover from this situation. If this event occurs frequently, it is likely that the snapshot policy on the primary volume in the cascade is deleting snapshots too soon.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the snapshot policy on the primary (read-write) volume and increase the retention count of the snapshots that must be backed up all the way to the destination.
*Syslog Message*::
Latest snapshot %s on the destination %s is not the base snapshot. Attempting a local rollback based SnapMirror resync to correct this issue.
*Parameters*::
*snap_name* (STRING): Name of the latest snapshot on the SnapMirror or SnapVault destination.
*dst_path* (STRING): Destination volume of the SnapMirror/SnapVault relationship.

== smc.snapmir.partnr.noconnect

*Syslog Message*::
Source volume "%s" and destination volume "%s" with relationship UUID "%s" lost heartbeat to partner node.
*Parameters*::
*srcpath* (STRING): Path name of the source volume of the SnapMirror relationship.
*dstpath* (STRING): Path name of the destination volume of the SnapMirror relationship.
*relationship_id* (STRING): Relationship UUID.
