== vifmgr.cluscheck.notassigned
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the named cluster logical interface (LIF) is not assigned to any network port.
*Corrective Action*::
Verify that the LIF's current port is configured administratively "up". Use the "network interface show" command to determine the current port of the LIF. Use the "network port show -fields up-admin" command to show the port's administrative state. Ensure that the network cabling connecting the remote network port is in place and secure. Ensure that the remote network port is configured administratively "up". If the port's link state is "up", attempt to migrate the cluster LIF to another cluster port. Use the "network port show" command to view the port's link state. If the current port is "up", use the "network interface migrate" command to migrate the LIF to another port.

Cluster LIF %s (node %s) is not assigned to any port.
*Parameters*::
*lif_name* (STRING): Name of the cluster LIF.
*node_name* (STRING): Name of the node on which the cluster LIF resides.

== vifmgr.cluscheck.sameRmtDev
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the home ports of the two cluster LIFs used for internal cluster replicated database (RDB) operations are connected to the same cluster switch. These LIFs should be connected to different cluster switches for optimal cluster resiliency.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "network port show -ipspace Cluster -fields remote-device-id" command to verify that the home ports of the specified cluster LIFs are connected to different cluster switches. If necessary, re-home one of the cluster LIFs to a port that is connected to the other switch. For help, search the NetApp knowledge base for "ONTAP Cluster interconnect management communication is improperly configured".
*Syslog Message*::
Cluster LIFs "%s" and "%s" on node "%s" are used for RDB operations. The home ports of these LIFs are connected to the same cluster switch: "%s".

*clus2_lif* (STRING): Name of a cluster LIF.
*node* (STRING): Node name of the cluster LIFs.
