== wafl.spcmgmt.policyConflict
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a space management strategy or an autosize grow threshold for a volume is being configured and the autogrow or autodelete thresholds conflict with the space-mgmt-try-first policy. The conflict can arise when the autogrow threshold is less than the autodelete threshold and the space-mgmt-try-first policy is configured for "snap_delete". The conflict can also arise when the autogrow threshold is more than the autodelete threshold and space-mgmt-try-first is configured for "volume_grow".
*Corrective Action*::
Consider changing either the space-mgmt-try-first policy with the command "volume modify -volume <volume_name> -space-mgmt-try-first <option>" or the autogrow threshold with the command "volume modify -volume <vol_name> -autosize-grow-threshold-percent <value>", and keep them in sync.
*Syslog Message*::
While configuring "%s" for volume "%s", space_mgmt_try_first policy ("%s") is conflicted with the autogrow threshold (%d%%) and autodelete threshold (%d%%).
*Parameters*::
*command* (STRING): Command being executed.
*volume_name* (STRING): Name of the volume.
*space_mgmt_try_first* (STRING): space-mgmt-try-first policy for volume_grow or snap_delete.
*grow_threshold* (INT): Used-space threshold, as a percentage, for the automatic growth of the volume.
*delete_threshold* (INT): Used-space threshold, as a percentage, for the auto-deletion of snapshots.
