== wafl.vvol.xfer.nospacedestErr
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when transfer to a destination flexible volume has fails because the aggregate that contains this volume is out of space.
*Corrective Action*::
For non-ASA r2 platforms, increase space available in the aggregate by either adding disks or freeing space by deleting aggregate Snapshot copies, shrinking flexible volumes or moving flexible volumes to another aggregate. Ensure that there is sufficient space available in the aggregate (using the "df -A command") to accommodate the flexible volumes it contains. The "volume size" command may be used to obtain flexible volume sizes and also to grow or shrink them. For ASA r2 platforms, increase space in an aggregate by either adding disks to the cluster or freeing space by deleting data or Snapshot copies. To delete a Snapshot copy, use the "vserver consistency-group snapshot delete" command.

Transfer to volume "%s%s%s" failed because the containing aggregate, "%s", is out of space.

*vol* (STRING): The volume name
*app* (STRING): Application universal unique identifier(UUID)
*volident* (STRING): To uniquely identify the volume in cases where volume name itself is insufficient.
